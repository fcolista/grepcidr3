Version 3.0
============

- Fix -h flag

Version 2.991
============

- Add -D for partial range matching
- Fix minor bugs
- More extensive debugging info incuded with -DDEBUG

Version 2.99
============

- Add -C to match CIDR ranges in the input

Version 2.98
===========

- Make 0.0.0.0/0 work
- Replace fgets() with getline() so it can handle arbitrary line
  lengths in non-mmap files
- Twiddle state machine so ::::ffff:1.2.3.4 and ::::1 are recognized
  as IPv6
- Match IPv6 after 8 groups so 1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:junk works
- Fix bug that allowed oversize values in first v6 group
- Peek after last colon in low group so 1::2:junk works

Version 2.97
===========

- Quick flag doesn't recognize v4 with dots before or after, to limit
  false matches in rDNS names

Version 2.96
===========

- New -s flag to stop comlaints about sloppy (misaligned CIDRs)
- CIDRs now always properly bit aligned, even if the base address wasn't
- Minor bug fixes

Version 2.95
===========

- Rewritten to use a faster state machine recognizer and mapped files,
  about 3 times faster overall, no speed penalty for matching through
  the whole line
- Handles both IPv4 and IPv6 patterns
- Better error checking
- Handle multiple input files

Version 1.3
===========
- Much faster than past versions due to binary search of patterns
- Decreased memory usage
- Applied search improvements suggested by Dick Wesseling <ftu@fi.uu.nl>
- Now supports IP ranges as well as CIDR format
- Improved usage to be more grep-like (e.g. filename on command line)
- Now uses grep-like exit code (0=ok, 1=no match, 2=error)


Version 1.2
===========
- Improved algorithm for faster processing with large number of patterns
  (approx. 50 times as fast on test set, with specs from diverse regions)


version 1.1
===========
- New algorithm has increased speed by about 2.4 times!
- Added -c (count) option, like grep
- Reduced memory usage in case loading large files (-f)
- Added simple Makefile


version 1.0
===========
- First public release
